    "description": "The Tillandsia stricta is a small to medium sized air plant that has thick green leaves that grow upwards spiraling along the center of the plant.  This variety of Tillandsia is usually a rich, dark green color and is a very hearty plant making it great for terrariums and other semi-enclosed displays.  As the stricta air plant matures, the thick leaves begin to interweave, creating an almost bush like appearance.  The plant will eventually produce a spike that is the same green coloring of the plant, and soon after will produce brilliant pink/purple hued flowers that are sure to steal the show in any room they are displayed.",
